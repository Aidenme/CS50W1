        There are eight planets and two dwarf planets in our solar system. Before 1992 the solar system was thought to contain nine planets including the dwarf planet Pluto. Scientists discovered a number of objects of a similar size to Pluto which caused them to question whether Pluto should be designated as a planet. In 2005 an object more massive than Pluto was discovered. This object, "Eris", lead to the creation of the new classification "dwarf planet", which Eris and Pluto both hold. A list of all planets and dwarf planets in the solar system can be found below:

Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite.</p>
